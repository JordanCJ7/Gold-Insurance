## Sass Implementation

This project uses Sass (SCSS syntax) for more maintainable and organized CSS. The styles are structured following a component-based approach with the 7-1 pattern (adapted):

- **_variables.scss**: Contains all color definitions, font settings, spacing variables, and breakpoints
- **_mixins.scss**: Contains reusable style patterns including:
  - Flexbox helpers (`flex-center`, `flex-column`)
  - Media query mixins for responsive design
  - Button styling mixins
  - Animation and transition mixins
- **_reset.scss**: Base reset and global styles for consistent cross-browser rendering
- **_transitions.scss**: Page transition animations and loading effects
- **Layout components**:
  - **_header.scss**: Navigation and site header styles
  - **_footer.scss**: Site footer and bottom navigation
  - **_slider.scss**: Image carousel implementation
- **Page-specific styles**:
  - **_homepage.scss**: Styles for the landing page and overview sections
  - **_packages.scss**: Insurance product cards and pricing tables
  - **_contact.scss**: Contact form and information display
  - **_feedback.scss**: Testimonial styling and feedback form
  - **_about.scss**: Company information, team profiles, and history section

The main.scss file imports all partials in the correct order to ensure proper cascade and specificity.

## Page Transitions

The site features smooth page transitions with a loading animation:

- Transition overlay appears when navigating between pages using the primary color scheme
- Custom loader animation with dual-circle design provides visual feedback during page load
- Smooth fade-in and fade-out effects enhance the user experience with 0.5s transition duration
- Implemented using CSS transitions and JavaScript timing controls
- Overlay is automatically triggered on page load and when clicking navigation links

## Design and UI Elements

### Color Scheme
The NobleTrust website uses a carefully selected color palette that conveys trust, stability, and premium service:

- Primary color: Gold (#ffd700) - Represents prestige, value, and excellence
- Primary dark: #bfa100 - Used for hover states and depth
- Background: Light off-white (#f8f8f8) - Provides a clean, professional appearance
- Text colors: Various shades from #222 to #555 - Ensures readability and hierarchy
- Accents: Light cream (#fffbe6) and cream (#faf3c0) - Complement the gold tones

### Typography
- Primary font: Arial, sans-serif - Chosen for excellent readability across devices
- Hierarchical type scale:
  - Base font size: 1rem
  - Headings scale from 1.2rem to 2.5rem
  - Careful line spacing enhances readability

### Responsive Design Implementation
The website employs a mobile-first approach with responsive breakpoints:

- **Mobile view** (< 768px): Single column layout, optimized navigation
- **Tablet view** (768px - 1024px): Two-column grids, expanded navigation
- **Desktop view** (> 1024px): Multi-column layout with enhanced visual elements

The responsive implementation uses:
- Fluid typography with rem units
- Flexbox for component layouts
- CSS Grid for page structure
- Media queries to adjust layouts at breakpoints

- Collapsible menu on mobile devices
- Current page highlighting
