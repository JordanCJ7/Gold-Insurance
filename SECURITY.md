## Security Considerations

As NobleTrust is primarily a static website, security considerations include:

- Content injection prevention
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) protection
- Secure form handling for contact and feedback forms
- Protection of user data collected through forms

## Best Practices Implemented

The NobleTrust website follows these security best practices:

1. Input validation for all form fields
2. Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation
3. Regular security audits of third-party dependencies
4. Secure hosting environment

## Bug Bounty Program

We currently do not have a formal bug bounty program, but we do acknowledge security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities to us in our project's documentation.
